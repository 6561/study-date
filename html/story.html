	<br><div id="paragraph"><h2><p>Two days after moving into my dorm at Boston University, I met Zack, who lived in the room directly across the hall from me. He and I were both interested in CS, and a few weeks later, we were talking about participating in a hackathon, so we decided to form a team and apply to a Hackathon. He introduced me to one of his friends from his CS class, Ivan. We met up and discussed various ideas, but there hadn't been a plan on which we were set.</p>
	<p>Then, during a brainstorming session before the opening ceremony, we came up with an idea we thought would be funny: a dating app based around academia and specifically tailored to students on the concept of a "study date", hence the title.</p>
	<p>Since teams were allowed up to 4 members, we wanted to find another person. After the opening ceremony, there was an event where groups with ideas would go to the stage and propose their ideas in hopes of recruiting a teammate. We got a lot of laughs from the audience, but we weren't sure how it went. We waited, and at the end, a girl named Jamie approached us: she was a senior at Bridgewater State minoring in CS, and she was interested in our idea and potentially joining our team. We talked about our ideas and how much background we had, and we agreed to join forces. We all had different strengths: I had Java, Javascript, and some SQL and web design experience; Ivan also knew Java, and he had already published a few iOS apps as personal projects. Zack was good at finding resources and easily the best at an elevator pitch (note that, while on stage, he did all the talking), and Jamie had a lot of experience with UI and Android Studio. So we got to work...</p>
